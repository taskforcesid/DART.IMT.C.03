/*
Write a C-program that converts metric measurements to 
imperial system values. Measurements are provided to your 
program in meters, grams or degrees Celsius and must be
converted to feet, pounds and degrees Fahrenheit, respectively.

Here are the conversion rules to use:

1 meter = 3.2808 feet;

1 gram = 0.002205 pounds;

temperature in degrees Fahrenheit = 32 + 1.8 Ã— temperature in 
degrees Celsius.

On the first input line you are given the number of conversions 
to be made. Each of the following lines contains a value to be 
converted as well as its unit: m, g or c (for meters, grams or 
degrees Celsius). There will be a space between the number and 
the unit. You should print your output value for each input line 
immediately after calculating it (ie, you do not have to wait 
until you have read all inputs).

Display the converted values with 6 decimal places, followed 
by a space and their unit: ft, lbs or f (for feet, pounds or 
degrees Fahrenheit). Each conversion result should be printed 
on its own line, and you should store and display all decimal 
values as doubles.
